# Uber-Rides-Data-Analysis-using-Python
**#Overview**
#This project analyzes Uber ride data to extract insights on travel patterns, peak times, ride purposes, and distances traveled. It leverages Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data processing and visualization.

**Dataset**
The dataset (UberDataset.csv) contains ride details such as start and end times, category, purpose, and miles traveled.

Missing values in the PURPOSE column are handled by replacing them with "NOT".

Date and time values are converted to datetime format for analysis.

**Key Features**
**Data Cleaning:**

Handling missing values and duplicates.

Extracting date, time, and day-night categorization for better insights.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Categorical Analysis: Visualizing ride purpose and category distribution using count plots.

Time-based Analysis: Identifying peak ride hours and trends across months and weekdays.

Correlation Analysis: Using heatmaps to understand relationships between numerical variables.

Distance Analysis: Distribution of ride distances using box plots and histograms.

**Visualizations & Insights**
Ride Purpose vs Category: Understanding business vs personal ride trends.

Monthly Ride Trends: Identifying the busiest months for Uber rides.

Weekday Trends: Analyzing ride distribution across different days.

Distance Analysis: Understanding the spread of miles traveled per trip.

**Technologies Used**
Python

Pandas for data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

Google Colab for running the analysis

**How to Run the Project**
Load the dataset (UberDataset.csv) in the same directory.

Run the Python script (uber_rides_data_analysis_using_python.py) in Google Colab or a local Python environment.

Visualizations will be displayed inline.

**Conclusion**
This project helps uncover key insights from Uber ride data, identifying patterns in ride purpose, timing, and travel distance. These insights can be used for better demand forecasting and route optimization.
